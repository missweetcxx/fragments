235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the
lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."
